# learnsynth

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Video compression previously relied on the `flutter_video_compress` package.
This dependency has been removed for compatibility with recent Flutter
versions. If compression functionality is needed in the future, consider using
[`ffmpeg_kit_flutter`](https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit) which is better
maintained and offers extensive media processing features.
